Architecture

The project follows **Clean Architecture** with a **Feature-first** folder structure.
```

│   ├── errors/         # Exceptions and failures

└── shared/             # Reusable widgets
```

Each feature is divided into three layers:

- **Data** — Knows about JSON, API, Hive. Contains models with `fromJson`, datasources and repository implementations.
- **Domain** — Pure Dart. Contains entities, repository interfaces (abstract classes) and use cases. No dependencies on external packages.
- **Presentation** — UI layer. Contains Riverpod providers, screens and widgets.

---

State Management — Why Riverpod?

**Riverpod** was chosen over Provider and BLoC for the following reasons:

- **Compile-time safety** — providers are verified at compile time, no runtime ProviderNotFoundException
- **No BuildContext dependency** — providers can be accessed outside the widget tree
- **FutureProvider.family** — elegant solution for parameterized async data (movie detail by ID)
- **StateNotifier** — clean separation between state and business logic
- **Provider.family** — efficient per-movie favorite status without rebuilding entire list
- **ref.invalidate()** — simple retry mechanism for failed requests

---

Environment Variables

The API key is stored in a `.env` file and never hardcoded in the source code.
The `.env` file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure.
```
TMDB_API_KEY=your_key_here
TMDB_BASE_URL=https://api.themoviedb.org/3
TMDB_IMAGE_BASE_URL=https://image.tmdb.org/t/p
```
